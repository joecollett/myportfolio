      <h2>Hello! Thanks for dropping by...</h2>
      <p class="margin-bottom-sm">I am a UI / front-end web developer with over 7 years professional experience who currently works for iiPay. I love designing and building elegant and accessible user experiences, while always striding and pushing to develop and enhance my current skillset.</p>        
      <p>During the last few years I have been a part of many different projects helping me to become a more well rounded front-end developer - These include helping to build and develop web applications, adding responsive functionality to previous and new systems, company branding and much much more.  My aim is to always make my design work simple with a clean code base no matter what size the project may be.</p>
      <p>From these experiences I have amassed a variety of different skills. These include scaffolding web pages using HTML5 and CSS3, building single page applications using Angular and TypeScript, as well as taking into account best practices in usability and accessibility to design aesthetically pleasing wireframes, mockups and prototypes. These are designed in Balsamiq and Adobe XD with image manipulation taking place in Photoshop to ensure clients get the best and most accurate reflection of what their website will look like once complete.</p>
